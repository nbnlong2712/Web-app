# 1) Goals & Scope
- **Goal:** Users describe needs in natural language → receive 3–12 relevant tools in ≤ 1 second, with a clear affiliate CTA.
- **In-scope (MVP):**
  1. Home with **Chat Search** + results grid.
  2. **Library** showing all tools + chip filters.
  3. **Tool Detail** (modal + route `/t/[slug]`) with **Visit** CTA.
  4. **Affiliate Redirect** `/go/[slug]` + log **clicks** + UTM.
  5. Seed **100–200 tools** from CSV.
- **Out-of-scope (MVP):** user accounts, reviews/ratings, auto-crawler, Meilisearch/pgvector, payments.
