# Action Planning

## Top 3 Priority Ideas

1. **MVP Chat Search + Filters**
   - Rationale: Differentiated UX, addresses natural-language intent → better conversion.
   - Next steps: Design taxonomy; implement server action to parse intent; Postgres FTS queries.
   - Resources: 1 FE, 1 BE (Next.js + Supabase); 1 content curator to seed 100 tools.
   - Timeline: 1–2 weeks (seed in parallel).

2. **Library Grid + Modal + Affiliate Redirect**
   - Rationale: Browse-all view, clear CTA, measurable click-through.
   - Next steps: Card component, Modal, `/go/[slug]` logging; ISR for detail pages.
   - Resources: FE dev + Supabase tables + light content.
   - Timeline: ~1 week.

3. **Data Schema & Admin Import**
   - Rationale: Real data to launch quickly.
   - Next steps: Create tables; admin CSV upload; metadata checklist.
   - Resources: BE dev + Notion/Sheet.
   - Timeline: 3–4 days.
