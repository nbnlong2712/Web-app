title: QA Gate - Story 1.18 - Refactor 404 Page and Verify Routing Configuration
status: PASS
date: 2025-09-18
reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
story_file: docs/stories/1.18.story.md
executive_summary: |
  The implementation for Story 1.18 has been thoroughly reviewed and meets all acceptance criteria. The 404 page has been successfully refactored to be a Server Component, routing configuration has been verified, and all required E2E tests have been added and are passing.
  
  Key accomplishments:
  - The custom 404 page (`src/app/not-found.tsx`) is now a Server Component with the "use client" directive removed
  - Navigation in the 404 page has been implemented using a server-safe link approach
  - The redirect from the home page to the Library page (`/library`) has been verified to work correctly
  - The Library page has been confirmed to exist and render even when the database is empty
  - Configuration files have been sanity-checked to ensure no `basePath`, rewrites, or redirects conflict with routing
  - There is no middleware intercepting root navigation
  - The route handler signature in `src/app/go/[slug]/route.ts` has been updated to match Next.js 15 expectations
  - E2E tests have been added to verify navigation and 404 handling

risk_assessment: |
  Low risk. The changes are focused on refactoring existing components and verifying routing configuration, with no significant architectural changes or new feature implementations that could introduce instability.

  - Functionality: All acceptance criteria have been met
  - Reliability: The implementation handles edge cases appropriately
  - Usability: The 404 page provides clear navigation options
  - Maintainability: The refactored code follows established patterns
  - Testability: Comprehensive E2E tests have been added
