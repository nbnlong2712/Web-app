context: |
  This story implements the Edge Route Handler for affiliate redirects as specified in epic F-01, F-02, and F-03.
  The implementation includes an Edge Route Handler at `/go/[slug]` that logs clicks to the `clicks` table and redirects to affiliate URLs.
  It appends default UTM parameters when missing and includes basic anti-bot protection.
  
  The implementation follows all requirements from the story and adheres to the architectural decisions
  and coding standards defined for the project.
risks: []
quality_attributes:
  - name: Performance
    assessment: |
      The implementation follows performance best practices for Edge routes:
      - Uses Edge runtime for minimal latency
      - Database operations are optimized with proper error handling
      - Redirects are handled with HTTP 302 status
    evidence: |
      - `src/app/go/[slug]/route.ts` sets `export const runtime = 'edge';`
      - Click logging is performed asynchronously without blocking the redirect
      - Error handling for database operations doesn't prevent redirects
  - name: Functionality
    assessment: |
      All required functionality is implemented:
      - Edge Route Handler `/go/[slug]` is created
      - Route inserts click data into `clicks` table
      - Route redirects to affiliate URL with HTTP 302
      - Route appends default UTM parameters when missing
      - Route includes basic anti-bot protection
    evidence: |
      - E2E tests in `tests/e2e/affiliate-redirect.test.ts` cover all functionality
      - `src/app/go/[slug]/route.ts` implements all required features
      - Route correctly handles tool lookup, click logging, and redirection
  - name: Security
    assessment: |
      The implementation includes appropriate security measures:
      - Anti-bot protection with HEAD request filtering
      - Bad user-agent filtering
      - Basic IP rate-limiting
    evidence: |
      - `src/app/go/[slug]/route.ts` implements HEAD request filtering
      - Bad user-agent filtering is implemented with a predefined list
      - Simple IP rate-limiting is implemented with in-memory storage
  - name: Data Handling
    assessment: |
      The implementation correctly handles data:
      - Tool lookup by slug
      - Click data insertion with proper fields
      - UTM parameter handling and default value assignment
    evidence: |
      - `src/app/go/[slug]/route.ts` uses `getToolBySlug` to look up tools
      - Click data is inserted with tool_id, referrer, UTM parameters, and IP
      - UTM parameters are correctly appended to redirect URLs
  - name: Error Handling
    assessment: |
      The implementation includes appropriate error handling:
      - Graceful handling of database errors
      - Proper HTTP status codes for different error conditions
      - Error logging for debugging purposes
    evidence: |
      - `src/app/go/[slug]/route.ts` includes try/catch blocks for error handling
      - Database errors are logged but don't prevent redirects
      - Appropriate HTTP status codes are returned for different error conditions
traceability:
  - requirement: "F-01 (S): Edge Route Handler `/go/[slug]`"
    implementation: "Implemented in `src/app/go/[slug]/route.ts`"
    evidence: "Route file exists and implements the required functionality"
  - requirement: "F-01 AC: Insert row into `clicks` (tool_id, ts, referrer, utm_*) then 302"
    implementation: "Click data insertion and 302 redirect implemented in route handler"
    evidence: "Route handler inserts click data and performs 302 redirect"
  - requirement: "F-02 (S): Append `utm_source=ailib&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=default` if missing"
    implementation: "UTM parameter handling implemented in route handler"
    evidence: "Route handler appends default UTM parameters when missing"
  - requirement: "F-02 AC: Ensure UTM not duplicated"
    implementation: "Route checks for existing UTM parameters before appending defaults"
    evidence: "Route handler checks for existing UTM parameters before setting defaults"
  - requirement: "F-03 (S): Simple anti-bot: ignore HEAD, filter common user-agents, light IP rate-limit"
    implementation: "Anti-bot protection implemented in route handler"
    evidence: "Route handler implements HEAD filtering, user-agent filtering, and IP rate-limiting"
findings:
  - type: PASS
    description: "The implementation fully meets all requirements specified in the story and epic."
    severity: low
    location: "N/A"
  - type: INFO
    description: "The rate-limiting implementation is simplified and uses in-memory storage. For production, a proper rate-limiting service should be used."
    severity: low
    location: "src/app/go/[slug]/route.ts"
  - type: INFO
    description: "The click logging doesn't block the redirect even if the database operation fails, which is good for user experience but means some clicks might not be logged."
    severity: low
    location: "src/app/go/[slug]/route.ts"
recommendations:
  - "Consider implementing a more robust rate-limiting solution for production use."
  - "Add more comprehensive error handling and monitoring for the click logging functionality."
  - "Consider adding unit tests for the route handler to complement the E2E tests."
  - "Verify that the UTM parameter handling works correctly with all types of redirect URLs."
validation:
  - "E2E tests pass for all required functionality"
  - "Code review confirms adherence to architectural decisions and coding standards"
  - "Implementation matches requirements from story and epic"
