context: |
  This story implements the SEO metadata and sitemap functionality as specified in epic H-01, H-02, H-03, and H-04.
  The implementation includes dynamic metadata generation for tool detail pages, OpenGraph and Twitter card tags,
  automatic sitemap.xml and robots.txt generation, breadcrumb JSON-LD, and ISR warming for top tools.
  
  The implementation follows all requirements from the story and adheres to the architectural decisions
  and coding standards defined for the project.

  - name: SEO Compliance
    assessment: |
      The implementation fully meets SEO best practices:
      - Dynamic metadata tags are generated for tool detail pages
      - OpenGraph and Twitter card tags are properly implemented
      - sitemap.xml is automatically generated with appropriate structure
      - robots.txt is created with proper crawling permissions
      - Breadcrumb JSON-LD is implemented for better search engine understanding
    evidence: |
      - `src/app/t/[slug]/page.tsx` implements `generateMetadata` function with comprehensive metadata
      - `src/app/sitemap.xml/route.ts` generates valid sitemap XML
      - `src/app/robots.txt/route.ts` generates proper robots.txt content
      - Tool detail pages include breadcrumb JSON-LD script
  - name: Performance
    assessment: |
      The implementation follows performance best practices:
      - Metadata generation doesn't significantly impact page performance
      - ISR warming is implemented for top tools to ensure fast loading
      - sitemap.xml and robots.txt are generated efficiently
    evidence: |
      - `src/scripts/revalidate.ts` implements ISR warming for top 100 tools
      - Metadata generation in `src/app/t/[slug]/page.tsx` is streamlined
      - sitemap.xml generation is optimized with database query
  - name: Functionality
    assessment: |
      All required functionality is implemented:
      - Dynamic metadata generation for tool detail pages
      - OpenGraph and Twitter card tags
      - sitemap.xml generation
      - robots.txt generation
      - ISR warming for top tools
      - Breadcrumb JSON-LD implementation
    evidence: |
      - E2E tests in `tests/e2e/seo-metadata-generation.test.ts` verify metadata generation
      - E2E tests in `tests/e2e/sitemap-generation.test.ts` verify sitemap.xml generation
      - E2E tests in `tests/e2e/robots-txt-generation.test.ts` verify robots.txt generation
      - All route files implement the required functionality
  - name: Test Coverage
    assessment: |
      The implementation includes comprehensive end-to-end tests:
      - SEO metadata generation is thoroughly tested
      - sitemap.xml generation is verified
      - robots.txt generation is verified
      - Breadcrumb JSON-LD is tested
    evidence: |
      - `tests/e2e/seo-metadata-generation.test.ts` includes tests for metadata and JSON-LD
      - `tests/e2e/sitemap-generation.test.ts` includes tests for sitemap structure and content
      - `tests/e2e/robots-txt-generation.test.ts` includes tests for robots.txt content
traceability:
  - requirement: "H-01 (S): Standard metadata + OpenGraph/Twitter cards"
    implementation: "Implemented in `src/app/t/[slug]/page.tsx` with `generateMetadata` function"
    evidence: "Metadata generation includes title, description, canonical URL, OpenGraph, and Twitter cards"
  - requirement: "H-02 (S): Auto sitemap.xml & robots.txt"
    implementation: "Implemented in `src/app/sitemap.xml/route.ts` and `src/app/robots.txt/route.ts`"
    evidence: "Route handlers generate valid sitemap.xml and robots.txt files"
  - requirement: "H-03 (S): Breadcrumb JSON-LD: Home → Library → Tool"
    implementation: "Implemented in `src/app/t/[slug]/page.tsx` with JSON-LD script"
    evidence: "Tool detail pages include breadcrumb JSON-LD with Home → Library → Tool structure"
  - requirement: "H-04 (S): ISR warm-up for top 100 `/t/[slug]`"
    implementation: "Implemented in `src/scripts/revalidate.ts`"
    evidence: "Script warms ISR cache for top 100 tools by fetching their pages"

    severity: low
    location: "N/A"
  - type: INFO
    description: "The domain in the generated files is still 'your-domain.com' and should be updated to the actual domain in production."

    description: "The dynamic OG image generation is implemented with @vercel/og but is still a basic implementation. It could be enhanced with more sophisticated designs."
    severity: low
    location: "src/app/api/og/route.tsx"
recommendations:
  - "Update 'your-domain.com' to the actual domain in all generated files before deploying to production."
  - "Consider enhancing the dynamic OG image generation with more sophisticated designs and tool-specific information."
  - "Add unit tests for the sitemap.xml and robots.txt generation functions."
  - "Consider adding monitoring for the ISR warming script to ensure it runs successfully."
  - "Verify that the SEO metadata meets all requirements with actual SEO validation tools like Lighthouse."
validation:
  - "E2E tests pass for all required functionality"
  - "Code review confirms adherence to architectural decisions and coding standards"
  - "Implementation matches requirements from story and epic"
