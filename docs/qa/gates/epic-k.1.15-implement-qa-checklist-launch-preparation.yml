  - name: Code Quality
    assessment: |
      The implementation has good code quality:
      - No TypeScript errors that prevent successful compilation
      - No ESLint errors that violate coding standards
      - Code follows project conventions and styling
    evidence: |
      - `npm run typecheck` passes with no errors
