# Story 1.1: Verify & Finalize Baseline of Existing Next.js Project (TypeScript + App Router)  

## Status 
APPROVED

## Story
**As a** developer, **I want** to verify and finalize the baseline configuration of the existing Next.js project with TypeScript and App Router, **so that** I have a solid foundation for building the AI Tools Library application.  

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Project uses TypeScript and successfully typechecks (tsconfig present; typecheck passes)
2. App Router is configured and working
3. ESLint and Prettier are set up for code quality
4. Basic project structure is in place following the repository layout
5. Development server can be started and accessed
6. No project re-initialization occurs (no `create-next-app` rerun; no overwriting scaffolded files)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Baseline verification (no re-initialization)
  - [x] Confirm presence of Next.js, React, TypeScript deps and `tsconfig.json`
  - [x] Verify App Router structure exists and renders (`app/`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`)
- [x] Configure/Verify ESLint and Prettier
  - [x] If missing, install ESLint and Prettier dependencies
  - [x] Configure ESLint with Next.js recommended rules (or verify existing config)
  - [x] Set up/verify Prettier with consistent formatting rules and ESLint integration
- [x] Set up basic project structure
  - [x] Ensure initial directory structure matches the source tree specification
  - [x] Add placeholder files for key directories (components, lib, app, etc.) only if missing

## Dev Notes
### Project Structure
The project should follow the repository layout defined in the architecture documents:  

```
ai-tools-library/
├─ app/
│ ├─ layout.tsx
│ └─ page.tsx
├─ components/
├─ lib/
├─ styles/
├─ public/
├─ tests/
├─ next.config.mjs
├─ tailwind.config.ts
├─ postcss.config.js
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components and Framer Motion for animations
- **UI Theme**: Neo-Glassmorphism (dark gradient background, glass cards and modals)

### Coding Standards
- Use absolute imports via `@/` paths (`tsconfig.paths`)
- One file = one exported entity. File name mirrors the exported name
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` → default export allowed (name must match file)
- Hooks/Utils: `camelCase.ts` with named export matching the file name  

[Source: docs/architecture/coding_standards.md]  

### Testing Standards
- Unit testing with Vitest + Testing Library per entity
- Server testing: mock external I/O; verify DB calls via fakes/spies
- Add/keep tests for new/changed logic  

[Source: docs/architecture/coding_standards.md#8]  

## Testing
### Test file location
- Tests should be placed in `tests/unit/` directory or alongside the component being tested
- Test files should be named `*.test.ts(x)`  

### Test standards
- Use Vitest for unit testing
- Use @testing-library/react for React component testing
- Write tests for new logic as it's implemented  

### Testing frameworks and patterns to use
- Vitest + @testing-library/react
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify functionality with explicit assertions rather than snapshots
