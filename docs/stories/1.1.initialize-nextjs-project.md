# Story 1.1: Initialize Next.js Project with TypeScript and App Router

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize a Next.js project with TypeScript and App Router,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for building the AI Tools Library application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js project is initialized with TypeScript support
2. App Router is configured and working
3. ESLint and Prettier are set up for code quality
4. Basic project structure is in place following the repository layout
5. Development server can be started and accessed

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and App Router
  - [ ] Run `npx create-next-app@latest` with TypeScript and App Router options
  - [ ] Verify project structure matches Next.js 13+ App Router conventions
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier
  - [ ] Install ESLint and Prettier dependencies
  - [ ] Configure ESLint with Next.js recommended rules
  - [ ] Set up Prettier with consistent formatting rules
- [ ] Set up basic project structure
  - [ ] Create initial directory structure matching the source tree specification
  - [ ] Add placeholder files for key directories (components, lib, app, etc.)
- [ ] Verify development environment
  - [ ] Ensure `npm run dev` starts the development server
  - [ ] Confirm the default Next.js page loads correctly
  - [ ] Test that TypeScript compilation works without errors

## Dev Notes
### Project Structure
The project should follow the repository layout defined in the architecture documents:

```
ai-tools-library/
├─ app/
│  ├─ layout.tsx
│  └─ page.tsx
├─ components/
├─ lib/
├─ styles/
├─ public/
├─ tests/
├─ next.config.mjs
├─ tailwind.config.ts
├─ postcss.config.js
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components and Framer Motion for animations
- **UI Theme**: Neo-Glassmorphism (dark gradient background, glass cards and modals)

### Coding Standards
- Use absolute imports via `@/` paths (`tsconfig.paths`)
- One file = one exported entity. File name mirrors the exported name
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` → default export allowed (name must match file)
- Hooks/Utils: `camelCase.ts` with named export matching the file name

### Testing Standards
- Unit testing with Vitest + Testing Library per entity
- Server testing: mock external I/O; verify DB calls via fakes/spies
- Add/keep tests for new/changed logic

[Source: docs/architecture/coding_standards.md#8]

## Testing
### Test file location
- Tests should be placed in `tests/unit/` directory or alongside the component being tested
- Test files should be named `*.test.ts(x)`

### Test standards
- Use Vitest for unit testing
- Use @testing-library/react for React component testing
- Write tests for new logic as it's implemented

### Testing frameworks and patterns to use
- Vitest + @testing-library/react
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify functionality with explicit assertions rather than snapshots
