# Story 1.11: Implement Admin Import Functionality

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** admin/editor,
**I want** to import tools via CSV form,
**so that** I can quickly seed the database with 100-200 tools.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `/admin/import` page is created with CSV upload form
2. Form validates CSV structure and maps columns to schema
3. Import process shows created/updated counts and row-level error reporting
4. Admin protection is implemented via env access key
5. Slug generation and tag normalization work correctly
6. Import process performs within acceptable time limits

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create admin import page
  - [x] Create `app/admin/import/page.tsx` with form and upload functionality
  - [x] Implement env access key protection
  - [x] Design user-friendly import UI
- [x] Implement CSV parsing and validation
  - [x] Add file upload and parsing functionality
  - [x] Validate CSV structure against expected schema
  - [x] Implement column mapping interface
- [x] Add preview functionality
  - [x] Show preview of first 10 rows before import
  - [x] Allow user to confirm or cancel import
- [x] Implement import logic
  - [x] Process CSV rows and upsert to `tools` table
  - [x] Generate `slug` if missing
  - [x] Normalize `tags` from `;` separated values
- [x] Add error handling and reporting
  - [x] Show created/updated counts
  - [x] Report row-level errors with details
  - [x] Handle database errors gracefully
- [x] Test import functionality
  - [x] Test with valid and invalid CSV files
  - [x] Verify slug generation and tag normalization
  - [x] Test performance with large datasets

## Dev Notes
### Import Requirements
- `/admin/import` (CSV form + server action)
- Show created/updated counts; row-level error reporting
- Generate `slug` if missing; normalize `tags` from `;`
- Protect via env access key or simple Basic Auth

### Data Model
Tables:
- `tools`: Core catalog of AI tools and attributes

Schema (DDL):
```sql
create table if not exists tools (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  name text not null,
  slug text unique not null,
  description text,
  homepage_url text,
  affiliate_url text,
  primary_tag text,
  tags text[],
  pricing text check (pricing in ('free','freemium','paid')),
  platform text check (platform in ('web','api','desktop')),
  language text[],
  no_signup boolean default false,
  status text default 'live',
  last_updated date,
  created_at timestamp default now()
);
```

### Security
- Protect via env access key or simple Basic Auth

[Source: docs/epic/epic-g-admin-import.md]

## Testing
### Test file location
- Tests should be placed in `tests/e2e/` directory for end-to-end testing
- Test file: `tests/e2e/admin-import.test.ts`

### Test standards
- Test CSV upload and parsing with various file formats
- Verify column mapping and preview functionality
- Test import process with valid and invalid data
- Verify slug generation and tag normalization
- Test error reporting for invalid rows

### Testing frameworks and patterns to use
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Test with various CSV formats and edge cases
- Mock Supabase client for testing database interactions
- Verify access key protection works correctly
- Test performance with large datasets

## QA Results
**Status: PASS**

**Gate File:** [epic-g-admin-import.1.11-implement-admin-import.md](../qa/gates/epic-g-admin-import.1.11-implement-admin-import.md)

**Summary:**
The implementation of the Admin Import functionality has been reviewed and now passes all quality gates. All the concerns raised in the previous QA review have been fully addressed. The implementation includes the actual CSV import process using server actions, with access key validation moved to the server-side. CSV parsing has been improved to handle quoted values and commas within fields. Unit tests have been added for CSV parsing and import logic, and E2E tests have been updated to better cover the import functionality.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Critical functionality is now fully implemented - the actual CSV import process is implemented with server actions.
- ✅ Security implementation has been improved - access key validation is now done server-side using a private environment variable.
- ✅ CSV parsing has been improved to handle quoted values and commas within fields properly.
- ✅ Server actions for import are now connected to the page component to perform actual imports.
- ✅ Unit tests have been added for CSV parsing and import logic.
- ✅ E2E tests have been updated to better cover the full import process.
- ✅ All functional requirements have been met.

**Additional Improvements:**
- Created utility functions for CSV parsing and data normalization to improve code organization.
- Added better error handling and reporting for the import process.
- Improved the authentication flow to use server-side validation.
- Added comprehensive unit tests for utility functions.
