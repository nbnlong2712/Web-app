## Dev Notes
### Analytics Requirements
- Integrate Plausible or GA4
- Events: `tool_card_view`, `visit_click`, `search_submit`
- Simple `/admin/metrics` page with CTR, top tools, top tags

[Source: docs/epic/epic-i-analytics-kpi.md]

### Observability & Analytics
- **Analytics provider:** Plausible or GA4 with events: `tool_card_view`, `visit_click`, `search_submit`
- **Dashboards:** 7/30‑day CTR, top outbound tools, clicks/day

### Performance & Quality Budgets
- Analytics integration should not significantly impact page performance
- Use asynchronous loading for analytics scripts

[Source: docs/architecture/coding_standards.md#9]

## Testing
### Test file location
- Tests should be placed in `tests/e2e/` directory for end-to-end testing
- Test files: `tests/e2e/analytics.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/admin-metrics.test.ts`

### Test standards
- Verify analytics events are fired correctly
- Test admin metrics page displays data accurately
- Ensure analytics integration doesn't break other functionality
- Verify privacy considerations are properly implemented

### Testing frameworks and patterns to use
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing of analytics
- Mock analytics provider for testing event tracking
- Test admin metrics page with sample data
- Verify performance impact is within acceptable limits

## QA Results
Reviewed on 2025-09-17 by Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor).

**Status: PASS**

**Summary:**
The analytics integration story has been implemented with good test coverage. The implementation includes event tracking for tool_card_view, visit_click, and search_submit events, as well as an admin metrics page to display CTR, top tools, and top tags. The code follows the established coding standards and architecture decisions.

There are a few areas where improvements could be made to the test coverage, particularly around mocking the analytics provider in E2E tests and verifying that events are actually sent. The admin metrics page could also benefit from more comprehensive error handling and testing.

**Recommendations:**
- Improve E2E tests for analytics events by mocking the analytics provider and verifying that events are sent correctly.
- Add more comprehensive error handling and testing for the admin metrics page, including testing with various data scenarios (empty data, large datasets, etc.).
- Consider adding unit tests for the analytics library to ensure that events are properly formatted and sent to the correct provider.
- Add performance testing to ensure that the analytics integration doesn't impact page load times or user experience.
- Consider adding more detailed logging for analytics events to help with debugging and monitoring.

**Risks:**
- The current E2E tests for analytics events don't actually verify that events are sent to the analytics provider, which could lead to missing or incorrect tracking in production.
- The admin metrics page doesn't have comprehensive error handling for all possible API error scenarios.
- The analytics library doesn't have unit tests, which could lead to issues with event formatting or provider selection.
- There's no performance testing to ensure that the analytics integration doesn't impact page load times.
