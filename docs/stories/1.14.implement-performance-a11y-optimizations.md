# Story 1.14: Implement Performance and Accessibility Optimizations

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** a fast and accessible application,
**so that** I can efficiently find and use AI tools.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ISR cache is configured for 10m with revalidation on import
2. Images are lazy-loaded with correct `next/image` sizes
3. Lighthouse performance score is ≥ 85
4. Lighthouse accessibility score is ≥ 90
5. Performance optimizations don't break functionality
6. Accessibility features work across devices and browsers

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Configure ISR caching
  - [ ] Set ISR cache to 10m for relevant pages
  - [ ] Implement revalidation on import
  - [ ] Test cache behavior
- [ ] Optimize image loading
  - [ ] Use `next/image` for all images
  - [ ] Set correct sizes for responsive images
  - [ ] Implement lazy-loading for thumbnails
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations
  - [ ] Code-split heavy features
  - [ ] Optimize bundle sizes
  - [ ] Minimize render-blocking resources
- [ ] Ensure accessibility standards
  - [ ] Implement proper ARIA attributes
  - [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works
  - [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Test performance and accessibility
  - [ ] Run Lighthouse audits
  - [ ] Verify scores meet requirements
  - [ ] Fix any identified issues

## Dev Notes
### Performance & A11y Requirements
- ISR cache 10m; revalidate on import
- Lazy-load images; correct `next/image` sizes
- Lighthouse: Perf ≥ 85, A11y ≥ 90

[Source: docs/epic/epic-j-performance-a11y.md]

### Performance & Cost
- **Targets:** Home TTFB (SSR) ≤ 500ms, Library/Detail LCP fast via ISR; filter updates ≤ 300ms
- **Tactics:** DB indexes; small card payload; image lazy‑loading; ISR cache (10m) with on‑demand revalidation post‑import

[Source: docs/architecture/9-performance-cost.md]

### Styling, A11y & Motion
- **A11y:** visible focus states, semantic HTML, proper ARIA; SSR results region uses `aria-live="polite"`
- **Motion:** short (100–150ms) micro‑interactions; avoid excessive parallax/heavy animations

[Source: docs/architecture/coding_standards.md#7]

### Performance Budgets
- Home SSR TTFB ≤ 500ms (P50)
- Filter response ≤ 300ms where feasible
- Lighthouse Perf ≥ 85, A11y ≥ 90
- Use `next/image` with correct sizing; lazy‑load thumbnails; code‑split heavy features

## Testing
### Test file location
- Tests should be run using Lighthouse CLI
- Test files: Lighthouse reports for key pages

### Test standards
- Run Lighthouse audits on key pages (home, library, detail)
- Verify performance and accessibility scores
- Test on different devices and connection speeds
- Verify optimizations don't break functionality

### Testing frameworks and patterns to use
- Use Lighthouse CLI for automated testing
- Test on various device types and network conditions
- Verify image optimization with WebPageTest or similar tools
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
