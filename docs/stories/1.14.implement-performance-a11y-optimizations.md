## Dev Notes
### Performance & A11y Requirements
- ISR cache 10m; revalidate on import
- Lazy-load images; correct `next/image` sizes
- Lighthouse: Perf ≥ 85, A11y ≥ 90

[Source: docs/epic/epic-j-performance-a11y.md]

### Performance & Cost
- **Targets:** Home TTFB (SSR) ≤ 500ms, Library/Detail LCP fast via ISR; filter updates ≤ 300ms
- **Tactics:** DB indexes; small card payload; image lazy‑loading; ISR cache (10m) with on‑demand revalidation post‑import

[Source: docs/architecture/9-performance-cost.md]

### Styling, A11y & Motion
- **A11y:** visible focus states, semantic HTML, proper ARIA; SSR results region uses `aria-live="polite"`
- **Motion:** short (100–150ms) micro‑interactions; avoid excessive parallax/heavy animations

[Source: docs/architecture/coding_standards.md#7]

### Performance Budgets
- Home SSR TTFB ≤ 500ms (P50)
- Filter response ≤ 300ms where feasible
- Lighthouse Perf ≥ 85, A11y ≥ 90
- Use `next/image` with correct sizing; lazy‑load thumbnails; code‑split heavy features

[Source: docs/architecture/coding_standards.md#9]

## Testing
### Test file location
- Tests should be run using Lighthouse CLI
- Test files: Lighthouse reports for key pages

### Test standards
- Run Lighthouse audits on key pages (home, library, detail)
- Verify performance and accessibility scores
- Test on different devices and connection speeds
- Verify optimizations don't break functionality

### Testing frameworks and patterns to use
- Use Lighthouse CLI for automated testing
- Test on various device types and network conditions
- Verify image optimization with WebPageTest or similar tools
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

**Status: PASS**

**Summary:**
The performance and accessibility optimizations story has been implemented with attention to the key requirements. The implementation includes ISR caching configuration, image optimization with next/image, and improvements to accessibility features. The code follows the established coding standards and architecture decisions.

There are areas where test coverage could be improved, particularly around automated Lighthouse testing and more comprehensive accessibility testing with screen readers. The revalidation on import functionality could also benefit from more robust error handling.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement automated Lighthouse testing in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure performance and accessibility scores are consistently met.
- Add more comprehensive accessibility testing, including testing with actual screen readers and keyboard navigation on different devices.
- Improve error handling for the revalidation on import functionality to ensure that pages are properly revalidated even if some requests fail.
- Consider adding performance monitoring to track key metrics in production (TTFB, LCP, etc.).
- Add unit tests for the PlaceholderImage component to ensure it renders correctly.

**Risks:**
- The current testing approach relies on manual Lighthouse audits, which may not catch regressions in performance or accessibility.
- The revalidation on import functionality doesn't have comprehensive error handling, which could lead to pages not being properly revalidated after an import.
- There's no automated testing to ensure that the PlaceholderImage component renders correctly.
- There's no performance monitoring in place to track key metrics in production.
