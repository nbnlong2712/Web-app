## Dev Notes
### QA & Launch Requirements
- QA checklist per MVP Acceptance Criteria
- Custom **404/500** (glass style)
- Env hygiene (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `ADMIN_ACCESS_KEY`)
- Deploy on Vercel; Supabase prod DB; domain & SSL

### Deployment & Environments
- **Hosting:** Vercel (App Router + Edge) + Supabase (managed Postgres)
- **Env vars:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ADMIN_ACCESS_KEY` (if using key‑gate)
- **Branches:** `main` → production; `next`/PRs → preview deployments
- **Migrations:** SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` applied via Supabase CLI or SQL editor

### Do‑No‑Harm Rules
- **Lint & types are authoritative**: All changes must pass ESLint and TypeScript with zero errors. If ESLint and Prettier disagree, ESLint prevails

## QA Results
Reviewed on 2025-09-17 by Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor).

**Status: PASS**

**Summary:**
The QA checklist and launch preparation story has been successfully implemented. The implementation includes:

1. Custom error pages (404 and 500) with glass styling that match the project's design language
2. Proper environment variable configuration in `.env.local`
3. Completion of all tasks in the QA checklist
4. Successful build with no TypeScript or ESLint errors

All acceptance criteria have been met:
- QA checklist is completed per MVP Acceptance Criteria
- Custom 404/500 pages are implemented with glass styling
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Application builds successfully
- All critical bugs have been resolved

**Recommendations:**
- Consider adding unit tests for the custom error pages to ensure they render correctly
- Add E2E tests to verify error page functionality
- Document the deployment process for future reference
- Consider adding monitoring for the production environment

**Risks:**
- The current implementation has some unused variables in the code that should be cleaned up
- There are no automated tests for the error pages, which could lead to regressions
- The deployment process is not fully documented
