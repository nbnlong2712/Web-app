## Dev Notes
### QA & Launch Requirements
- QA checklist per MVP Acceptance Criteria
- Custom **404/500** (glass style)
- Env hygiene (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `ADMIN_ACCESS_KEY`)
- Deploy on Vercel; Supabase prod DB; domain & SSL

### Deployment & Environments
- **Hosting:** Vercel (App Router + Edge) + Supabase (managed Postgres)
- **Env vars:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ADMIN_ACCESS_KEY` (if using key‑gate)
- **Branches:** `main` → production; `next`/PRs → preview deployments
- **Migrations:** SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` applied via Supabase CLI or SQL editor

### Do‑No‑Harm Rules
- **Lint & types are authoritative**: All changes must pass ESLint and TypeScript with zero errors. If ESLint and Prettier disagree, ESLint prevails
