# Story 1.16: Fix 404 Page and Navigation Issues

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the application to start correctly on the home page and have a properly functioning 404 page with the agreed glass-style design,
**so that** I have a consistent and pleasant user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The app should start correctly and not default to a 404 page
2. The "Go Home" button should properly navigate back to the home screen
3. The 404 page should use the agreed glass-style design

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create `app/not-found.tsx` with glass-style design
  - [ ] Implement "Go Home" button with proper navigation
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Check that the application starts on the home page
  - [ ] Ensure no default redirect to 404 page
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Navigate to a non-existent page to verify 404 page appears
  - [ ] Test "Go Home" button functionality
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Confirm 404 page matches Neo-Glassmorphism design
  - [ ] Check responsive design on different screen sizes

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
This is a bug fix story addressing issues found after story 1.15 was completed.

### Data Models
No specific data models are required for this story.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints are needed for this story.

### Component Specifications
- Need to create a custom 404 page component that follows the Neo-Glassmorphism design
- The 404 page should include a "Go Home" button that correctly navigates to the home page

### File Locations
- App directory: `app/not-found.tsx` (for the 404 page)
- Components directory: `components/ui/button.tsx` (if not already created)
- Styles: `styles/globals.css` (for glass styling classes)

### Testing
List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
- Test file location: Tests should be placed in the `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Follow the existing testing patterns in the project
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Use Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for E2E tests
- Any specific testing requirements for this story:
  - End-to-end test for navigation to non-existent page
  - Unit test for "Go Home" button functionality
  - Visual test to ensure glass-style design is applied correctly

### Technical Constraints
- Use Next.js App Router conventions for the 404 page
- Implement the Neo-Glassmorphism design as specified in the project documentation
- Ensure the "Go Home" button uses Next.js routing for navigation

## QA Results

âœ… **Status: PASS**

**Summary:**
Comprehensive review of Story 1.16: Fix 404 Page and Navigation Issues.

This story addresses important user experience issues related to application routing and error handling. The requirements are clear and well-defined with appropriate acceptance criteria.

Key strengths of this story:
- Addresses a critical user experience issue (incorrect 404 handling)
- Clear acceptance criteria mapped to specific tasks
- Follows established patterns for Next.js App Router
- Includes appropriate testing requirements
- Aligns with project design standards (Neo-Glassmorphism)

Areas for consideration:
- The story depends on existing components (button) which should be verified
- Testing requirements are well-specified but implementation details should be confirmed

No critical or high severity issues identified. The story is ready for development.

**Risk Assessment:**
Risk level: LOW

This is a bug fix story addressing user experience issues. The changes are localized to the 404 page implementation and navigation functionality. 

Potential risks:
- Low: Dependency on existing button component implementation
- Low: Correct implementation of Next.js routing conventions
- Low: Proper application of Neo-Glassmorphism design

Mitigation strategies:
- Verify existing components meet requirements before implementation
- Follow established Next.js App Router patterns
- Confirm design implementation with project standards

Overall risk is low as this is a focused bug fix with minimal scope for unintended side effects.

**Test Coverage:**
Status: ADEQUATE

The story includes appropriate testing requirements:
- End-to-end test for navigation to non-existent page
- Unit test for "Go Home" button functionality
- Visual test to ensure glass-style design is applied correctly

These cover the main functional aspects of the requirements. 

Recommendations:
- Ensure tests cover responsive design verification
- Consider adding accessibility tests for the 404 page
- Verify error boundary handling in addition to 404 page

**Requirements Traceability:**
- Requirement: "The app should start correctly and not default to a 404 page"
  Acceptance Criteria: "AC-1"
  Test Scenarios: 
    - "Verify application loads home page by default"
    - "Check no redirect to 404 on valid routes"
    - "Confirm proper routing configuration"

- Requirement: "The 'Go Home' button should properly navigate back to the home screen"
  Acceptance Criteria: "AC-2"
  Test Scenarios:
    - "Test 'Go Home' button functionality from 404 page"
    - "Verify navigation returns to home page"
    - "Check browser history handling"

- Requirement: "The 404 page should use the agreed glass-style design"
  Acceptance Criteria: "AC-3"
  Test Scenarios:
    - "Confirm 404 page implements Neo-Glassmorphism design"
    - "Verify responsive design on different screen sizes"
    - "Check visual consistency with project standards"

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Requirement: "Use Next.js App Router conventions for the 404 page"
  Status: VERIFIED
  Notes: "Correctly specified in technical constraints"

- Requirement: "Implement the Neo-Glassmorphism design as specified in the project documentation"
  Status: VERIFIED
  Notes: "Referenced in multiple sections of the story"

- Requirement: "Ensure the 'Go Home' button uses Next.js routing for navigation"
  Status: VERIFIED
  Notes: "Specified in technical constraints"

**Code Quality:**
Status: NOT_APPLICABLE
Notes: "Review is of story requirements, not implementation"

**Security:**
Status: NOT_APPLICABLE
Notes: "No security implications identified for this story"

**Performance:**
Status: NOT_APPLICABLE
Notes: "No performance implications identified for this story"

**Accessibility:**
Status: ADEQUATE
Notes: "Story should include accessibility considerations for the 404 page, particularly for navigation. This should be verified during implementation."
