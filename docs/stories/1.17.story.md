# Story 1.17: Update Default Route and Search Bar Height

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the application to start on the Library screen and have a properly sized search bar,
**so that** I can easily browse and search for AI tools with a consistent user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When launching the app, the first screen displayed is the Library screen instead of the 404 error screen
2. The 404 error page styling is updated according to the UI style definitions (including background) from docs/prd.md
3. The Search bar width remains unchanged, but its height is increased from 40px to 160px to improve visibility and touch target size
4. The search bar styling maintains the Neo-Glassmorphism design with proper responsive behavior across all screen sizes

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Update the default route in `app/page.tsx` to redirect to the Library page (`/library`)
  - [ ] Ensure the root route (`/`) properly redirects to the Library page using Next.js redirect functionality
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Update the 404 error page styling in `app/not-found.tsx` to match the Neo-Glassmorphism design
  - [ ] Implement the dark gradient background with subtle noise as specified in the UI style guide
  - [ ] Apply glass container styling with blur (12-16px), border (`rgba(255,255,255,0.18)`), and soft shadow effects
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Modify the SearchBar component in `components/SearchBox.tsx` to increase height from 40px to 160px
  - [ ] Ensure the search bar maintains its current width while increasing height
  - [ ] Verify responsive design is maintained across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - [ ] Ensure the search bar maintains glass styling with blur (12-16px), border (`rgba(255,255,255,0.18)`), and soft shadow

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
This story builds upon the previous work done on the 404 page and routing. The previous story (1.16) addressed similar issues with the 404 page, but this story focuses on updating the default route and search bar styling.

### Data Models
No specific data models are required for this story.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints are needed for this story.

### Component Specifications
- **SearchBar Component** (`components/SearchBox.tsx`):
  - Current height: 40px, New height: 160px
  - Maintain existing width: 100% with max-width of 720px
  - Maintain glass styling as per Neo-Glassmorphism design:
    - Background: `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`
    - Blur: 12-16px
    - Border: `rgba(255,255,255,0.18)` with 1px width
    - Shadow: soft shadow effect
    - Border radius: 2xl (24px)
  - [Source: docs/prd.md#ui-style-chosen-neo-glassmorphism]

- **404 Page Component** (`app/not-found.tsx`):
  - Implement glass containers with blur 12-16px
  - Background: dark gradient with subtle noise
  - Border: `rgba(255,255,255,0.18)` with soft shadow
  - Text styling should match the Neo-Glassmorphism theme
  - [Source: docs/prd.md#ui-style-chosen-neo-glassmorphism]

### File Locations
- App directory: 
  - `app/page.tsx` (for root route redirect)
  - `app/library/page.tsx` (Library page)
  - `app/not-found.tsx` (404 page)
- Components directory: `components/SearchBox.tsx` (SearchBar component)
- Styles: `styles/globals.css` (for glass styling classes)

### Testing
List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
- Test file location: Tests should be placed in the `tests/` directory
- Test standards: Follow the existing testing patterns in the project with both unit and E2E tests
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Use Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for E2E tests
- Any specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Unit test for route redirect functionality in `app/page.tsx`
  - Visual regression test for 404 page styling in `app/not-found.tsx`
  - Visual test to ensure search bar height change is correctly implemented in `components/SearchBox.tsx`
  - E2E test to verify the default route redirects to the Library page
  - Responsive design testing across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
  - Accessibility testing for the updated search bar (focus states, keyboard navigation)

### Technical Constraints
- Use Next.js App Router conventions for routing with proper redirect implementation
- Implement the Neo-Glassmorphism design as specified in the project documentation
- Ensure responsive design is maintained for the search bar across different screen sizes
- Maintain existing accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Follow existing CSS/Tailwind class naming conventions

âœ… **Status: PASS**

**Summary:**
Comprehensive review of Story 1.17: Update Default Route and Search Bar Height.

This story addresses important user experience improvements related to application routing and search functionality. The requirements are clear and well-defined with appropriate acceptance criteria.

Key strengths of this story:
- Addresses user experience issues with default routing
- Clear acceptance criteria mapped to specific tasks
- Follows established patterns for Next.js App Router
- Includes appropriate testing requirements
- Aligns with project design standards (Neo-Glassmorphism)
- Builds upon previous work (Story 1.16) in a logical progression

Areas for consideration:
- The search bar height increase is quite significant (40px to 160px) which may impact layout on smaller screens
- Testing requirements are well-specified but implementation details should be confirmed

No critical or high severity issues identified. The story is ready for development.

**Risk Assessment:**
Risk level: LOW

This story addresses user experience improvements with routing and search functionality. The changes are localized to route configuration and UI component styling.

Potential risks:
- Low: Significant increase in search bar height may impact layout on smaller screens
- Low: Dependency on existing components which should be verified
- Low: Correct implementation of Next.js routing conventions
- Low: Proper application of Neo-Glassmorphism design

Mitigation strategies:
- Verify responsive design thoroughly, especially on mobile devices
- Confirm existing components meet requirements before implementation
- Follow established Next.js App Router patterns
- Confirm design implementation with project standards

Overall risk is low as this is a focused enhancement with minimal scope for unintended side effects.

**Test Coverage:**
Status: ADEQUATE

The story includes appropriate testing requirements:
- Unit test for route redirect functionality
- Visual regression test for 404 page styling
- Visual test to ensure search bar height change is correctly implemented
- E2E test to verify the default route redirects to the Library page
- Responsive design testing across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Accessibility testing for the updated search bar

These cover the main functional aspects of the requirements.

Recommendations:
- Ensure tests specifically verify the search bar height change does not negatively impact layout on small screens
- Consider adding performance tests to ensure the larger search bar doesn't impact page load times
- Verify that the increased touch target size improves usability as intended

**Requirements Traceability:**
