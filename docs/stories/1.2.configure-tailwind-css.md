# Story 1.2: Configure Tailwind CSS and Neo-Glassmorphism Theme

## Status
APPROVED

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to configure Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui and implement the Neo-Glassmorphism theme,
**so that** I have a consistent styling foundation that matches the design specifications.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tailwind CSS is installed and configured correctly
2. shadcn/ui components are installed and working
3. Framer Motion is installed for animations
4. Neo-Glassmorphism theme tokens are defined (colors, blur, borders, shadows)
5. Glass UI components can be created using the theme tokens
6. Basic styling works on the default page

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS
  - [x] Install Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and autoprefixer
  - [x] Create `tailwind.config.ts` with proper configuration
  - [x] Create `postcss.config.js` with Tailwind plugin
  - [x] Add Tailwind directives to global CSS file
- [x] Install shadcn/ui components
  - [x] Set up shadcn/ui CLI
  - [x] Configure components directory
  - [x] Install basic components (Button, Card, Dialog, etc.)
- [x] Install Framer Motion for animations
  - [x] Add Framer Motion dependency
  - [x] Verify basic animations work
- [x] Implement Neo-Glassmorphism theme
  - [x] Define theme tokens in Tailwind config (colors, blur, borders, shadows)
  - [x] Create a `.glass` utility class for reusable glass effect
  - [x] Implement proper dark gradient background
- [x] Create sample glass components
  - [x] Create a glass card component using the theme
  - [x] Add micro-interactions (100-150ms) with Framer Motion
  - [x] Verify styling works on default page

## Dev Notes
### UI Framework
Tailwind + shadcn/ui, motion via Framer Motion; theme: Neo-Glassmorphism (dark gradient background, glass cards and modals, 2xl radius, 100-150ms micro-interactions).

[Source: docs/architecture/5-front-end-application-structure.md]

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components and Framer Motion for animations
- **UI Theme**: Neo-Glassmorphism (dark gradient background, glass cards and modals)

[Source: docs/architecture/teck-stack.md]

### Styling, A11y & Motion
- **Tailwind-first**: Prefer composable utility classes; extract repeated class lists to a `cx` helper
- **Glass UI**: Respect theme tokens (blur, borders, subtle shadows)
- **Motion**: Short (100-150ms) micro-interactions; avoid excessive parallax/heavy animations

### Project Structure
Key directories for styling:
```
├─ components/
│  ├─ ui/                             # shadcn/ui components
├─ styles/
│  ├─ globals.css
│  └─ tailwind.css
```

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS as the primary styling solution
- CSS Modules only for scoped overrides
- Follow the Neo-Glassmorphism theme with dark background and glass effects
- Implement proper accessibility with visible focus states and semantic HTML

[Source: docs/architecture/coding_standards.md#2]

## Testing
### Test file location
- Tests should be placed in `tests/unit/` directory or alongside the component being tested
- Test files should be named `*.test.ts(x)`

### Test standards
- Use Vitest for unit testing
- Use @testing-library/react for React component testing
- Write tests for new logic as it's implemented

### Testing frameworks and patterns to use
- Vitest + @testing-library/react
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify functionality with explicit assertions rather than snapshots
