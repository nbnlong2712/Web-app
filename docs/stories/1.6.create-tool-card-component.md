## Dev Notes
### Component Requirements
- `ToolCard`: 16:9 thumbnail, title, 2-line description, tag chips, pricing badge, Open ↗

[Source: docs/architecture/5-front-end-application-structure.md#components]

### Styling and A11y
- **Glass UI**: Respect theme tokens (blur, borders, subtle shadows)
- **A11y**: Visible focus styles, proper roles/labels, ESC to close modals, focus trap

### Project Structure
Key directories for components:
```
├─ components/
│  ├─ ToolCard.tsx
```

[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

### Example Implementation
**Compliant Component:**
```tsx
// components/ToolCard.tsx
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card"
import Link from "next/link"

export default function ToolCard({ tool }: { tool: { slug: string; name: string; description?: string; tags?: string[] } }) {
  return (
    <Card className="glass p-4">
      <div className="text-lg font-semibold line-clamp-1">{tool.name}</div>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground line-clamp-2">{tool.description}</p>
      <div className="mt-3 flex items-center justify-between">
        <div className="flex gap-2 overflow-x-auto">
          {tool.tags?.slice(0, 3).map(t => (
            <span key={t} className="text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded-full bg-white/10 border border-white/20">{t}</span>
          ))}
        </div>
        <Link href={`/t/${tool.slug}`} className="text-sm underline">Open ↗</Link>
      </div>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

### Technology Stack
- **UI Kit**: shadcn/ui; motion via Framer Motion

[Source: docs/architecture/teck-stack.md]

### Performance Budgets
- Use `next/image` with correct sizing; lazy-load thumbnails

[Source: docs/architecture/coding_standards.md#9]

## Testing
### Test file location
- Tests should be placed in `tests/unit/` directory
- Test file: `tests/unit/ToolCard.test.tsx`

### Test standards
- Unit test the ToolCard component with various tool data scenarios
- Test responsive behavior
- Verify accessibility features
- Test text truncation with long names/descriptions

### Testing frameworks and patterns to use
- Vitest + @testing-library/react for component testing
- Test with different tool data samples
- Verify ARIA attributes are properly set
- Test keyboard navigation
