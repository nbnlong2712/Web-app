# Story 1.7: Implement Library Grid Page

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** to browse all tools in a responsive grid layout on the library page,
**so that** I can discover AI tools without needing to search.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `/library` page is created with ISR (10m revalidation)
2. Page renders a responsive grid of ToolCard components
3. Grid layout adapts to different screen sizes (1-4 columns)
4. Page includes basic SEO meta tags
5. Skeleton loading states are implemented for initial load
6. Empty state is displayed when no tools are available

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create library page component
  - [ ] Create `app/library/page.tsx` with ISR configuration
  - [ ] Implement responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS
  - [ ] Add basic SEO meta tags (title, description)
- [ ] Implement grid rendering
  - [ ] Fetch tools data from Supabase with basic query
  - [ ] Map tools data to ToolCard components
  - [ ] Implement responsive grid (1 column on mobile, 2-4 on desktop)
- [ ] Add loading states
  - [ ] Implement skeleton loading for initial page load
  - [ ] Show loading state during data fetching
- [ ] Implement empty state
  - [ ] Design and implement empty state UI
  - [ ] Provide helpful messaging when no tools are available
- [ ] Test responsive behavior
  - [ ] Verify grid layout on different screen sizes
  - [ ] Test loading and empty states
  - [ ] Verify ISR behavior

## Dev Notes
### Page Requirements
- `/library` (ISR 10m) renders 3–4 column grid
- Responsive; Lighthouse A11y ≥ 90

[Source: docs/epic/epic-c-library-grid-filters.md]

### Routing & Rendering Strategy
- `/library` **ISR (5–15m)**: Global browse grid with filters; hydrates for client-side facet toggles without full reload

[Source: docs/architecture/2-routing-rendering-strategy-nextjs-app-router.md]

### Performance & Quality Budgets
- Use `next/image` with correct sizing; lazy‑load thumbnails; code‑split heavy features
- Lighthouse Perf ≥ 85, A11y ≥ 90

## Testing
### Test file location
- Tests should be placed in `tests/e2e/` directory for end-to-end testing
- Test file: `tests/e2e/library-page.test.ts`

### Test standards
- Test responsive grid layout on different screen sizes
- Verify ISR behavior and caching
- Test loading and empty states
- Verify accessibility standards are met

### Testing frameworks and patterns to use
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Test grid layout with different viewport sizes
- Verify SEO meta tags are correctly set
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
