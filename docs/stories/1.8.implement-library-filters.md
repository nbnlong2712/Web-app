# Story 1.8: Implement Library Filters

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** to filter tools by category, tags, price, platform, and language,
**so that** I can quickly find tools that match my specific needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Filter components are implemented (category/tags chips + pricing/platform/language panel)
2. Filters work without full page reload (client-side updates)
3. Filter state is synchronized with URL query parameters
4. Filters update results within ≤300ms
5. "Reset filters" functionality works correctly
6. Filter components are accessible and responsive

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create filter components
  - [ ] Design and implement category/tags chip filters
  - [ ] Create pricing/platform/language filter panel
  - [ ] Ensure proper styling with Neo-Glassmorphism theme
- [ ] Implement filter logic
  - [ ] Create filter state management
  - [ ] Implement client-side filtering logic
  - [ ] Add performance optimization for filtering (<300ms)
- [ ] Integrate filters with URL
  - [ ] Sync filter state with URL query parameters
  - [ ] Read initial filter state from URL on page load
  - [ ] Update URL when filters change
- [ ] Add reset filters functionality
  - [ ] Implement "Reset filters" button
  - [ ] Reset all filters to default state
  - [ ] Clear URL parameters when resetting
- [ ] Implement accessibility features
  - [ ] Add proper ARIA attributes
  - [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works
  - [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Test responsive behavior
  - [ ] Verify filter components on different screen sizes
  - [ ] Test touch interactions on mobile devices

## Dev Notes
### Filter Requirements
- Filters: Category/Tags chips + Pricing/Platform/Language panel
- Toggles without full reload; syncs with URL query
- Empty state + Reset filters

### Performance Budgets
- Filter response time ≤ 300ms

[Source: docs/architecture/coding_standards.md#9]

### UI Framework
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui, motion via Framer Motion; theme: Neo‑Glassmorphism (dark gradient background, glass cards and modals, 2xl radius, 100–150ms micro-interactions)

[Source: docs/architecture/5-front-end-application-structure.md]

### Styling and A11y
- **Tailwind‑first**: Prefer composable utility classes; extract repeated class lists to a `cx` helper
- **Glass UI**: Respect theme tokens (blur, borders, subtle shadows)
- **A11y**: Visible focus styles, proper roles/labels, ESC to close modals, focus trap

## Testing
### Test file location
- Tests should be placed in `tests/unit/` directory for unit testing
- Test file: `tests/unit/Filters.test.tsx`

### Test standards
- Test filter state management
- Verify URL synchronization works correctly
- Test performance of filtering operations
- Verify accessibility features
- Test responsive behavior

### Testing frameworks and patterns to use
- Vitest + @testing-library/react for component testing
- Mock router and search params for testing URL synchronization
- Test filtering performance with large datasets
- Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Test on different viewport sizes
