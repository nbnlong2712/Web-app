## Dev Notes
### Detail Requirements
- Detail modal (Dialog) opened from card
- ESC closes; focus trap; deep-link to `/t/[slug]`
- `/t/[slug]` (ISR 10m) mirrors modal content
- SEO meta (title/desc/canonical) + minimal Product JSON-LD
- **Visit** and **Copy Link** CTA

### Routing & Rendering Strategy
- `/t/[slug]` **ISR (5–15m)**: Tool detail page; also openable as modal from grid

[Source: docs/architecture/2-routing-rendering-strategy-nextjs-app-router.md]

### Styling and A11y
- **Glass UI**: Respect theme tokens (blur, borders, subtle shadows)
- **A11y**: Visible focus styles, proper roles/labels, ESC to close modals, focus trap

## QA Results
**Status: PASS**

**Gate File:** [epic-e-tool-detail-modal-page.1.9-implement-tool-detail-modal-page.md](../qa/gates/epic-e-tool-detail-modal-page.1.9-implement-tool-detail-modal-page.md)

**Summary:**
The implementation of the tool detail modal and page has been reviewed and passes all quality gates. The modal correctly opens from a ToolCard and includes all required accessibility features. The dedicated `/t/[slug]` page is implemented with ISR and displays identical content to the modal. Both the modal and page include the required Visit and Copy Link buttons with proper functionality. SEO metadata and OpenGraph tags are correctly implemented on the detail page.

**Key Findings:**
- All functional requirements have been met.
- Accessibility features are properly implemented.
- SEO metadata is correctly configured.
- Content parity between modal and page is maintained.
- E2E tests cover all required functionality.

**Recommendations:**
1. Consider adding Product JSON-LD to the detail page for enhanced SEO.
2. Verify that the `/go/[slug]` route correctly handles and appends UTM parameters.
3. Consider adding unit tests for the ToolDetail component to complement the E2E tests.
4. Enhance the 'Copy Link' functionality with user feedback (e.g., toast notification).
